# 2018/2019 Web Development Practice

This repo contains the my practice with Javascript, Express, Ruby, and Rails.

## Box It Script
Attempt to create a function that takes a string and outputs it in a box. Subsequent strings will be placed below the initial string and the box will adapt to a uniform size based on the longest string.

## Turtle Graphics
Practice with JS classes. Chained methods will store coordinates and eventually print them out in the console. The printout represents the 'turtle' that has travelled along a 2D plane

## HW_8
Contains files for a hangman game which primarily uses Javascript and JQuery. A practice in DOM manipulation
